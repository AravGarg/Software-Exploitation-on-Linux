# Software-Exploitation-on-Linux
Software exploits for programs on Linux

Note: The exploits here will work on x86-64 systems. x32 systems will require certain modifications to register values and sizes.

## Exploits for simple_login.c

### 1. go_shell_exploit will crack the login program without the need of a password.This exploit is made based on the source code of the program and hence is not arbitrary.
Execute as:
   
First compile simple_login.c with tcc :  ``` tcc -g -o Mysimple_login simple_login.c ```

Now execute with ```(cat go_shell_exploit;cat)|./Mysimple_login```

Enter a random first input.
This will crack the program and spawn a shell.
   
### 2. print_Owned_exploit is an arbitrary code execution exploit which will change the nature of the program from a login program to a program that prints 'Owned' on the screen.

```hello1_64.asm``` is the assembly script for the exploit.
Compile this with nasm:```nasm -f elf64 hello1_64.asm```. This will result in the output file ```hello1_64.o```

Now link this file with ```ld -o hello1_64 hello1_64.o```

hello1_64 is the executable. Check the opcodes for the instructions in this executable with:```objdump -d -M intel hello1_64```.

```hello_shell_64.pl``` is a perl script that prints the opcodes for shellcode generation.
Output this into a file with: ```./hello_shell_64.pl > hello.shellcode_64```.

Add nop instructions to fill in the required bytes in ```hello.shellcode_64```. The final exploit is ```print_Owned_exploit```.
Execute this as: ```./Mysimple_login < print_Owned_exploit```.


## Exploits for basic_vuln.c

### 1. shell_exploit is an arbitrary code execution exploit which will change the nature of the program to a program that spawns a shell on the screen.

First compile basic_vuln.c with tcc :  ``` tcc -g -o basic_vuln basic_vuln.c ```

```shell_64.asm``` is the assembly script for the exploit.
Compile this with nasm:```nasm -f elf64 shell_64.asm```. This will result in the output file ```shell_64.o```

Now link this file with ```ld -o shell_64 shell_64.o```

shell_64 is the executable. Check the opcodes for the instructions in this executable with:```objdump -d -M intel shell_64```.

```opcode_shell_exploit.pl``` is a perl script that prints the opcodes for shellcode generation.
Output this into a file with: ```./opcode_shell_exploit.pl > opcode_shell_exploit```.

Add nop instructions to fill in the required bytes in ```opcode_shell_exploit```. The final exploit is ```shell_exploit```.
Execute this as: ```./basic_vuln `cat shell_exploit` ```.
