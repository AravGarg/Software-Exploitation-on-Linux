On a binary, run readelf -l move  --> if loads segments are very few, the binary is possibly packed.
Full RELRO enabled --> cannot overwrite GOT as it is made read only.
overwrite got with plt address of another function(say system).
.fini_array is an array of functions that are called after main() returns. Thus we can overwrite the got entries of .fini_array if no other function is called.

popen() exploit:
when you give a command in the terminal, say "whoami" , the os looks for the executable named whoami is the PATH environment variable, from left to right. if we make a file with our own command (say "cat flag") and save this file with the name whoami,
and modify the environment variable such that it looks for this file first, then when whoami is called, it actually execcutes the "cat flag" command.
